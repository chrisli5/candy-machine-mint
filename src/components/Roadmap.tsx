                BAYC is a collection of 10,000 Bored Ape NFTsâ€”unique digital
                collectibles living on the Ethereum blockchain. Your Bored Ape
                doubles as your Yacht Club membership card, and grants access to
                members-only benefits, the first of which is access to THE
                BATHROOM, a collaborative graffiti board. Future areas and perks
                can be unlocked by the community through roadmap activations.
