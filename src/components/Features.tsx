            When you buy a Bored Ape, youâ€™re not simply buying an avatar or a
            provably-rare piece of art. You are gaining membership access to a
            club whose benefits and offerings will increase over time. Your
            Bored Ape can serve as your digital identity, and open digital doors
            for you.
