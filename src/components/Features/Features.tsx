          When you buy a Bored Ape, youâ€™re not simply buying an avatar or a
          provably-rare piece of art. You are gaining membership access to a
          club whose benefits and offerings will increase over time. Your Bored
          Ape can serve as your digital identity, and open digital doors for
          you.
